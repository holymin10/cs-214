Example1 Observation

The code is setup so that when you type start after running the program, it beginbs the yy_rule_setup case 1 which makes the program print "Start command received\n");
Then when you type stop, the program is set up so that it prints "Stop command received." It also stops the program. If the user inputs anything other than start and stop, 
they just get their characters echoed back to them.

Example2 Observation

Whatever we input we get either word, number, or the underscore which is echoed. Whenever you input an underscore, the program echoes the amount of underscores the user inputed.

Input: 2de 
Output: NUMBER
WORD
Reason: Recognises number then the letters

Input: r_3
Output: WORD
_NUMBER
Reason: Recognises Word then echoes the underscores then recognises the number

Input: eee__eee
Output: WORD
__WORD
Reason: Recognises Word then echoes the underscores then recognises the word again

Input: r3r3
Output: WORD
Reason: Recognises the whole thing as a word

Input: !
Output: !
Reason: Just echoes the special charater

Example3 Observation

Example4 Observation
Terminals are symbols whose meaning is predefined
Non terminals are symbols whose meanings must be defined. They are enclsed in angle-brackets.
There is nothing strange other than the fact that the output is inprecise. There is no temperature shown on the output nor is it precise with showing whether the heat is turned on or off.

Example5 Observation
Input: set temperature 59
Output:	Temperature set to 59
Input: heat on
Output:	Heat turned on
It is now much more precise and knows what it is doing.

Example6 Observation
In script. Added set_humidity.
